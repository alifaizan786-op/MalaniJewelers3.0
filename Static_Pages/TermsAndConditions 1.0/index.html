    <h2>6. Online Transactions</h2>

    <p>
      If you wish to purchase any Products or other goods or services
      through the Website (each, a <strong>Transaction</strong>), your
      payment will be processed securely through Shopify, our
      third-party payment service provider. By submitting your payment
      information, you agree to Shopify's terms, conditions, and
      privacy policies, which govern the processing of your payment.
      We do not collect or store your full credit card details.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may be asked to provide certain information relevant to your
      Transaction, including without limitation your name, billing
      address, shipping address, payment method details, and other
      identifying information. BY SUBMITTING THIS INFORMATION, YOU
      REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE THE
      PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDED. Although we strive to assist with any
      order-related issues, we are not responsible for errors, delays,
      or security breaches related to payment processing. If you
      experience any difficulties with payment authorization or
      processing, please contact Shopify directly. You are also
      welcome to Contact Us, and we will do our best to help
      facilitate a resolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your receipt of a Shopify confirmation or other electronic order
      confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of your order,
      nor does it represent a binding commitment to fulfill the order.
      The Company reserves the right at our sole discretion and at any
      time after an order is placed, to accept or decline the order,
      or to limit quantities available for purchase, for any reason or
      no reason at all. Without limiting the generality of the
      foregoing, we expressly reserve the right to refuse and cancel
      any order that appears to be placed in violation of these Terms,
      that cannot be processed or fulfilled due to inventory or
      pricing errors, or that is flagged by our third-party fraud
      detection services as suspicious, high-risk, or potentially
      fraudulent or unauthorized. We also reserve the right to cancel
      or refuse any order that, in our sole judgment, appears to be
      placed by resellers, distributors, or any party attempting to
      circumvent our standard purchase limits or fraud prevention
      protocols. If your order is canceled after your payment method
      has been charged, we will promptly instruct Shopify to issue a
      refund to the original payment method.
    </p>

      discretion.
    </p>

    <p>
      All orders placed on this site are subject to product
      availability and will be shipped according to the Company's
      shipping policies. In the unlikely event that your order does
      not arrive as scheduled, you must notify the Company
      immediately, such that notification is received within no more

    </p>

    <p>
      The inclusion of any Product on the Website does not guarantee
      that such Product will be available. It is your responsibility
      to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and
      international laws (including minimum age requirements)
      regarding the receipt, possession, use, and sale of any item
      purchased from this Website. You agree to pay all charges that
      may be incurred by you or on your behalf through the Website, at
      the price in effect when such charges are incurred, including
      without limitation all shipping and handling charges. In
      addition, you remain responsible for any taxes that may be
      applicable to your Transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Product Images and Descriptions</h2>

    <p>
      The Company endeavors to accurately describe and display all
      Products and services on the Website. Despite these efforts,
      items on the Website occasionally may be mispriced, described
      inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in
      updating Website information. As a result, we cannot and do not
      guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information. All
      descriptions, images, specifications, prices, availability, and
      other Content relating to the Products and services described or
      depicted on the Website are subject to change at any time
      without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weights, measures, and other descriptions are approximate and
      are provided for convenience purposes only. You may call the
      Company at (404) 298-6950 if you wish to clarify or confirm
      approximate measurements prior to purchase. The Company reserves
      the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors,
      inaccuracies, or omissions including after an order has been
      submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and
      your credit card charged.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Company makes every effort to display Product images and
      descriptions as accurately as possible. However, the colors,
      dimensions, and details you see on your screen may vary
      depending on your device settings and display capabilities. As a
      result, we cannot guarantee that the Product you receive will
      look exactly the same as it appears on your screen. Further,
      many of our items are handcrafted and incorporate natural stones
      or materials, which inherently feature unique characteristics
      and subtle variations in color, texture, shape, and symmetry.
      These natural differences are part of what makes each piece
      distinctive and should not be considered defects.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage you to review all Product images and descriptions
      carefully before completing a Transaction. In accordance with
      our Return Policy, we do not accept returns, exchanges, or
      refund requests based on natural variations, minor aesthetic
      differences, or perceived discrepancies between the Product and
      its online representation.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Sites</h2>

    <p>
      For your convenience, we may provide links or references to
      other websites that may be of interest to you. The Company does
      not control or endorse such websites, or the ideas, opinions,
      products, or services offered on such third-party sites. We are
