              >Birthstone jewelry has been a popular concept for
              centuries</strong
            >, and can be found in Western and Eastern traditions.
            Worldwide, this concept has been the same with a gemstone
            representing the month in which a person was born.
            However, the gemstones corresponding to the months have
            changed over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The origin of the tradition is generally traced back to
            the 12 gems set into the breastplate of a Jewish priest as
            outlined in the Bible. Over time, the concept of having a
            gemstone that symbolizes various qualities to represent a
            month became popular.
          </p>

            <h3>📿 The Evolution of Birthstones</h3>
            <p>
              There were no strict rules and many just focused on the
              color of the stone rather than the exact variety. For
              example, both garnet and ruby were used interchangeably
              as the birthstone for January due to having the same
              color, while even today tanzanite, turquoise, lapis
              lazuli and blue topaz can all be used as the birthstone
              for December as they are all blue stones.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Due to this general confusion, in 1912, the American
                National Association of Jewelers formally agreed on
                one standard list of birthstones.</strong

                  Rubies are made of corundum and are essentially a
                  red sapphire, known for their striking reddish hue.
                  This is a rare gemstone and it is difficult to find
                  large natural rubies as they are formed in small
                  sizes. Due to their durability and hardness, it is a
                  gemstone that is perfect for daily wear.

                  famous for. However sapphires come in a range of

                  are delicate gemstones with a 5.5 to 6.5 ranking,

                  Turquoise is one of the earliest stones to have been
                  mined, with a history that dates back over 3000
                  years! It is an opaque gemstone with an intriguing
                  color. It is the only gemstone that has a color
                  named after it. This color occurs due to the
                  presence of copper and occasional traces of iron
                  (which cause the greenish tint) that are present
                  during its formation. While bluish-green stones are
                  valued, it is the sky blue variety that is highly
                  coveted.

                  received as a gift. If the loved one was unfaithful,
                  it was believed the suitor would know because of the
                  change in the color of turquoise! While a appealing

                The tradition of birthstones is generally traced back
                to the 12 gems set into the breastplate of a Jewish
                priest as outlined in the Bible. In 1912, the American
                National Association of Jewelers formally agreed on
                one standard list of birthstones to reduce confusion.

                wearing any gemstone you love. Many people choose
                gemstones based on their personal preferences, color
                preferences, or the meanings they resonate with.

              Are there alternative birthstones for each month?

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes, some months have alternative birthstones. For
                example, December can be represented by turquoise,
                tanzanite, lapis lazuli, or blue topaz. Historically,
                people focused more on the color of the stone rather
                than the exact variety.

              Do birthstones have healing properties?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                While many cultures and traditions attribute healing
                and protective properties to gemstones, these beliefs
                are based on folklore and personal faith rather than
                scientific evidence. The beauty and symbolism of
                birthstones can certainly have positive emotional and
                psychological effects.

              How should I care for my birthstone jewelry?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Care depends on the specific gemstone's hardness and
                properties. Harder stones like diamonds and sapphires
                require minimal care, while softer stones like pearls
                and opals need gentle handling and proper storage.
                Always clean with appropriate methods and store
                separately to prevent scratching.

              <p>
                Birthstone jewelry makes meaningful, personalized
                gifts because they're uniquely connected to the
                recipient. Consider the person's style preferences,
                the occasion, and the symbolic meaning of their
                birthstone when selecting a piece.
