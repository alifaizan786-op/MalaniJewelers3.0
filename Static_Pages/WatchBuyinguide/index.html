                  A mechanical watch has a movement that's powered by
                  a mainspring—a coiled wire of metal—that is wound by
                  hand. Once the mainspring is wound, it slowly and
                  evenly unwinds, causing the second hand to move in a
                  smooth, sweeping motion around the watch's face.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Most mainsprings are about 9-13 inches long. The
                  longer the mainspring, the longer your mechanical
                  watch's power reserve, and the longer you can go
                  between windings. Not all mechanical movements are
                  created equal. The attention to detail and
                  craftsmanship that goes into a watch will determine
                  its smoothness and accuracy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For many aficionados, mechanical movement watches
                  represent the crème de la crème of timepieces due to
                  their traditional pedigree and the intricate work
                  and engineering that must go into creating them. For
                  these enthusiasts, owning a mechanical watch isn't
                  just about telling time, it's a way to express their
                  appreciation for history, refinement, and
                  craftsmanship.

                  <li>
                    <strong>No battery needed</strong> - Because a
                    mechanical watch is powered by a hand-wound
                    mainspring, you'll never have to go to a jeweler
                    to replace a battery. When the watch stops
                    ticking, just wind it up.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Smooth hand movement</strong> - For some
                    folks, a smooth sweeping movement on the second
                    hand is more aesthetically pleasing than the "tick
                    tick tick" of quartz watches.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Character</strong> - The engineering and
                    work that goes into a mechanical watch is
                    breathtaking. Inside your watchcase are tiny gears
                    and springs that work together to give you the
                    time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tactile</strong> - For some, one of the
                    appeals of a mechanical watch is that the owner
                    must hand-wind it to keep it working. There's
                    something about the ritual of winding your watch
                    at the end of the day that connects you more with
                    time.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Requires regular winding</strong> - While
                    most mechanical watch mainsprings can go two days
                    without winding, it's recommended that you wind it
                    once a day.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sensitive to the environment</strong> -
                    Moisture, dust, shocks, and magnets are the Four
                    Horsemen of the Mechanical Watch Apocalypse.
                    Thankfully, most modern varieties have been
                    designed to withstand these elements.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Not as accurate</strong> - While a
                    well-crafted mechanical watch can keep time to
                    99.999% accuracy (about +/- 1 second a day), with
                    age and use that accuracy starts to taper off.
                    You'll need tune-ups every 5 to 10 years.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Expensive</strong> - All that
                    craftsmanship and precision engineering that goes
                    into a mechanical watch is going to cost you
                    extra. While there are some good mechanical
                    watches in the sub-$500 range, most are more than
                    that.

                  Automatic watches are pretty much just like
                  mechanical—they're powered by a mainspring and use
                  intricate gears to move the watch hands—but they
                  don't require the user to hand-wind the watch to
                  keep it ticking. Instead, your movement throughout
                  the day winds up the mainspring while you wear the
                  watch. Hence, the name "automatic movement." They're
                  also known as "self-winding" watches.
                </p>

                <p>
                  How does an automatic movement watch self-wind?
                  Well, there's a small weight inside the watch called
                  a "rotor" that moves as your wrist moves throughout
                  the day. It's connected to the mainspring and winds
                  the mainspring as it moves. Automatic watches also
                  have a slipping clutch device to prevent the watch
                  from getting over-wound while you're wearing it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you're not wearing your automatic watch, you'll
                  want to put it in a watch winder. It's a little
                  device that moves the watch in a circular motion
                  while it's stored so it stays wound. This is
                  particularly important to do if your watch has
                  features like a calendar or date display. For
                  example, let's say your automatic watch has a
                  calendar on it, but you decide not to wear it for a
                  few days. If you don't store it in a winder, the
                  power will run down and the display will get stuck
                  on the time and date the watch stopped ticking.

                    you, but you still want the sophistication of a
                    mechanical watch, an automatic watch is a nice

                  wrist right now is probably a quartz watch. There's
                  a reason for that. Quartz watches are incredibly
                  accurate and very affordable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Instead of being powered by a wound mainspring, a
                  quartz movement uses electricity from a small
                  battery. The battery sends the electricity through a
                  small quartz crystal, causing the crystal to vibrate
                  32,768 times per second. The vibrations are measured
                  by a circuit, which converts the vibration into a
                  pulse, which moves the second hand on the watch.
                  Because quartz watches use electric pulses to move
                  the second hand, they have a distinctive "tick tick
                  tick" movement. It's not as smooth as a mechanical
                  or automatic watch.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because quartz movements rely on electricity and
                  fewer moving parts, they're much more accurate and
                  can withstand far more of a beating than mechanical
                  or automatic watches. It's for this reason that most
                  "sport" and "field" watches use a quartz movement.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Quartz movements are also dirt-cheap. $4 can get you
                  a watch that keeps time like a champ. Of course, if
                  you want something with a bit more panache, you'll
                  need to spend more.

                <h5>✓ Advantages</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Accurate time</strong> - Quartz is by far
                    the most accurate of all the movements. Will never
                    lose or add seconds throughout the day
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Less maintenance</strong> - Besides
                    changing the battery every year or so, there's
                    little maintenance you have to perform on a quartz
                    movement watch
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Durable</strong> - Because they have few
                    moving parts, a quartz watch can "take a licking
                    and keep on ticking." It's not as susceptible to
                    the Four Horsemen of the Watch Apocalypse
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Affordable</strong> - You can get quartz
                    watches for as cheap as a few bucks. Though nicer
                    looking ones can cost into the hundreds of
                    dollars, they're almost always cheaper than
                    mechanical and automatic varieties

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>No smooth movement</strong> - The
                    staggered movement of the second hand on a quartz
                    watch isn't as smooth as that of a mechanical or

                  <li>
                    <strong>Less romantic</strong> - The biggest con
                    of quartz watches is that they lack the charm,
                    character, and romance of mechanical watches
                    because they lack the history, technical
                    craftsmanship, and engineering such timepieces

            <h3>The Chronograph & Tachymeter</h3>
            <p>
              On some watches, a chronograph is paired with a
              tachymeter—a scale inscribed around the rim of a watch.
              Using the chronograph and tachymeter together allows a
              user to calculate all sorts of things like speed,
              distance traveled, or fuel consumption (when you're
              driving or flying).
            </p>
            <p class="complication-note">
              How many and which complications you want in a watch is
              a matter of preference. Dressier watches tend to be
              sleek and have one (usually the date) to none. More
              sporty and casual watches often include more
              complications.

                  well with a t-shirt and jeans.

                The field watch is the descendant of the WWI "trench
                watch," which was designed for officers who needed to
                coordinate attacks, tell time at night, and sport a
                wristwatch that could withstand the rigors of battle,
                all while still looking good. Field watches continue
                to evince a military-esque vibe and are rugged,
                functional, and stylish all at the same time.

                  pulling the crown out; this makes it easier to set
                  the watch to a reference signal, or synchronize it
                  with another

                <p>
                  Field watches are quite versatile and can be worn on
                  all kinds of adventures as well as for everyday
                  casual wear or even business casual. So everything
                  from jeans and a t-shirt, to a sports coat and
                  khakis. For men, especially younger guys, who don't
                  get dressed up in a suit very often, a field watch
                  is probably your best bet; its simple, rugged style
                  may best match your personality and lifestyle.

                Next to the field watch, the dive watch is probably
                one of the most common watch types you see men
                sporting. And we likely have James Bond to thank for
                that. Ever since Dr. No, 007 has been sporting a dive
                watch of some kind or another. In the early Bond
                films, it was a Rolex Submariner (which is why the
                dive watch is sometimes called a "submariner"); then
                Pierce Brosnan turned the Omega dive watch into Bond's
                timepiece of choice.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the name suggests, the dive watch was designed for
                individuals who spend a lot of time in or near water.
                The first iteration was likely the Rolex Oyster in the
                1930s with its hermetically sealed case. In the 1950s,
                Rolex board member René-Paul Jeanneret wanted a watch
                useful for diving but still looked good as an everyday
                timepiece. The Rolex Submariner was born and the
                standard for dive watches everywhere was set.

              The standard for a dive watch is to be water resistant
              up to at least 100m, though some keep ticking at even
              lower depths. Since it's designed to be worn in the
              water, both the case and the band of dive watches are
              made from corrosion-resistant metals like stainless
              steel or titanium. (You'll of course see dive watches
              made from rubber and silicone, too. They're just not as
              classy looking.)

                  A defining feature of the dive watch is the
                  uni-directional bezel included on the case—it will
                  only rotate counter-clockwise. The rotating bezel
                  allows a diver to know with just a glance at his
                  watch how long he's been underwater. Here's how it
                  works: when the diver enters the water, he rotates
                  the bezel so that the "0" lines up with the minute
                  hand. After that, the minute hand will point to the
                  marking on the bezel that shows how long he's been
                  in the water.

                  Typically bold, easy-to-read, Arabic numbering,
                  though the 12-hour numerals are often replaced with
                  hash marks, with the seconds displayed in 15-second
                  increments. To protect the watch face while deep
                  underwater, sapphire or hardened mineral glass is
                  used

                  While the dive watch was designed for underwater
                  use, its all-metal casing and band, plus its iconic
                  heritage, make it a suitable wristwatch for
                  versatile everyday wear. You can do it with your
                  sportswear, casual wear, business casual wear, and
                  business formal wear. And if you take your style
                  cues from James Bond, you can even get away with
                  wearing a dive watch with a tux.

              <p>
                Wristwatches have been a part of aviation since its
                inception. In fact, one of the first purpose-specific
                men's wrist watches ever made was for a pilot friend
                of Louis Cartier back in 1904 (the iconic Santos
                watch).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the decades after, watchmakers built on that
                original design to make timekeeping easy for pilots
                taking off into the wild blue yonder, most notably
                with the addition of a chronograph. Back in the 1930s,
                the Swiss company Breitling made onboard chronographs
                for planes in the Royal Air Force so pilots could
                determine their speed, distance traveled, and fuel
                consumption. In the 1940s, they decided to put their
                chronograph on a wristwatch—creating the Breitling
                Chronomat, as well as the mold for future aviator
                watches.

                  Designed for easy reading, even in a dark cockpit,
                  pilot watches sport an oversized dial with clean,

                Car racing and wristwatches have been linked together
                since the 1930s. That's because racecar driving relies
                on accurate timekeeping to measure the outcome of the
                race. Rolex was one of the first companies to
                capitalize on this need for accurate timepieces by
                outfitting top drivers with their famous Oyster watch
                back in the 1930s.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it was TAG Heuer that created the standard for
                racing watches by adding a chronograph and
                tachymeter—the two defining features of a driving
                watch. The first TAG Heuer chronographs were made in
                the 1930s and 1940s for pilots in the Luftwaffe, but
                by the 1950s and 1960s, racecar drivers were wearing
                them to measure their speed and distance. TAG Heuer
                cemented its racing bona fides when actor Steve
                McQueen wore their Monaco 1133 in the 1971 film, Le
                Mans.

                  Racing watches tend to be flashier looking than dive
                  or pilot watches. Because of their bold look,
                  they're more suitable for casual than formal wear

            <p class="lead-text">
              Once you decide what type and style of watch you want,
              you'll next need to decide what kind of price range to
              look in. When you see the $8,000 price tag on a Rolex
              Submariner or that a TAG Heuer Carrera goes for $4,500,
              you might ask yourself "Are these watches really worth
              that much if they tell time just as well as my $10
              Casio?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Well, that's a complicated question to answer and it
              somewhat depends on what sort of luxury watch we're
              talking about: mass market luxury watches or luxury
              luxury watches.
            </p>

              <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Mass-Market Luxury Watches</h3>
                <p>
                  One criticism levied at mass-market luxury watches
                  is that the high price is simply the result of
                  clever marketing. Rolex and TAG Heuer can charge
                  thousands of dollars for a watch not due to scarcity
                  (these companies mass-produce their iconic watches
                  by the hundreds of thousands each year), but because
                  they've created the perception in the public through
                  decades of advertising that their watches are rare
                  and worth thousands of dollars.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While it's true that high prices are partly due to
                  branding, there are factors in the watch itself that
                  make it worth more than your $200 department store
                  watch:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fine metals like gold and silver</li>
                  <li>Higher quality glass or sapphire crystal</li>
                  <li>Superior technology and design</li>
                  <li>Better build quality and longevity</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="value-insight">
                  With mass-market luxury watches, you're getting a
                  superior watch in terms of build and movement, but
                  you're also paying for the mystique, story, and
                  social cache that come with a brand name.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Luxury Luxury Watches</h3>
                <p>
                  These are watches that can cost tens of thousands
                  and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars.
                  Companies like Audemars Piguet, Blancpain, and IWC
                  exist in this realm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These watches can command these sorts of prices
                  because they're actually scarce. Oftentimes, just a
                  few hundred or maybe a thousand of a particular
                  watch are made. And this isn't some artificial
                  scarcity. They're often meticulously handcrafted
                  (with the help of machines of course) from the
                  finest materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of the watches from these companies take months
                  or even years to be finished.
                </p>
                <p class="value-insight">
                  So, yeah, with these types of luxury watches, you're
                  definitely getting what you pay for: high-end
                  craftsmanship.
