    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies:</strong>These
        cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our
        Website and how users use our Website. This information is
        aggregated and does not identify any individual users. We use
        this information to help us improve our Website and to gather
        demographic information and usage trends.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong>These cookies are essential
        to provide you with services available through our Website and
        to enable you to use some of its features, such as allowing
        you to log into secure areas of our Website. Without these
        cookies, the functionality that you have requested may not
        perform as expected, and we only use these cookies to provide
        you with this functionality.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow
        our Website to remember the choices you make when using our
        Website to enhance your user experience, such as remembering
        your login details and preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Media Cookies:</strong>These cookies are used
        when you share information using a social media sharing button
        or plugin on our Website, and when you engage with our content
        through a social media networking website. These cookies may
        track your browser across other sites and build a profile of
        your interests.

    <p>
      We may also permit third-party providers (e.g., email systems,
      analytics platforms, and payment processors) to use cookies or
      similar technologies on our Website in connection with their
      services. These third parties may collect information directly
      from your browser or device and are subject to such third
      party’s own separate privacy policies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that
      collect similar information for security and fraud detection and
      prevention purposes.
    </p>
    <p><i> Do Not Track (“DNT”) Signals.</i></p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and apps
      include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) setting that you can activate to
      signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
      technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. We do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
      your preference not to be tracked online.

      otherwise with your consent.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights with Respect to Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      You will receive notice when your personal information might be
      provided to a third party for any reason other than as set forth
      in this Privacy Policy, and you will have an opportunity to
      request that we not share such information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on your place of residence and the applicable data
      protection laws, you may have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Access and request a copy of the personal information we hold
        about you;
      </li>
      <li>Correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information;</li>
      <li>
        Request deletion of your personal information, subject to
        legal and operational exceptions;

        Object to or restrict the collection, processing, and/or use
        of your information in certain circumstances;

      <li>
        Request data portability, allowing you to obtain and reuse
        your personal information for your own purposes;

      <li>
        Withdraw your consent, to the extent that processing is based
        on such consent;

    <p>
      We reserve the right to verify your identity or take other
      actions that we believe are appropriate. We may refuse to comply
      with a request if the request is manifestly unreasonably or
      meritless, or it is excessive or repetitive in nature. We also
      may be entitled to refuse requests, wholly or partly, where
      exceptions under the applicable law apply. If you are a resident
      of a jurisdiction that grants you additional rights, we will

      Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will retain your personal
      information for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill
      the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for

      efforts to delete such information from our records. If you are
      a child under the age of 18, you are not authorized to submit
