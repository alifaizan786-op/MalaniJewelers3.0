      Introduction to Our Privacy Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines the practices and procedures of
      Malani Jewelers regarding the collection, use, and protection of
      personal information provided through our website,
      www.malanijewelers.com. It is intended to inform you of how we
      handle your data and what choices you have concerning the use of
      your information. This notice applies exclusively to data
      collected through our website.
    </p>

    <h3 class="visually-hidden">Types of Personal Data We Collect</h3>
    <h2>Information Collection, Usage, and Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Malani Jewelers is the sole proprietor of all data gathered
      through this website. The only personal information we collect
      is what you voluntarily provide—whether that’s through
      completing a form on our website, sending us an email, or
      communicating with us directly in any other way. This may
      include your name, contact details, purchase preferences, or any
      other details you choose to share.
    </p>

    <p>
      We assure you that we do not sell, rent, or lease your personal
      information to any third parties. The only instance where your
      information may be shared is with your explicit approval, and
      only when it directly pertains to fulfilling a transaction or
      meeting a specific service request related to your jewelry
      purchases.
    </p>

    <p>
      The information you share with us is primarily used to respond
      to your inquiries and to provide services related to your
      jewelry interests and needs. We may also use this information to
      improve our offerings, customer service, and overall website
      experience. Additionally, we may use the data to send you
      updates about upcoming product launches, special promotions,
      seasonal collections, pricing changes, or exclusive offers that
      may be of interest to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should you wish not to receive these communications, you have
      the right to opt out at any time. Simply contact us via the
      methods listed on our website or reply to any of our emails
      requesting removal from our mailing lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that Malani Jewelers reserves the right to amend or
      update this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be
      posted on this webpage, and we encourage you to review it
      periodically to stay informed of how we protect your
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Access to Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      You are entitled to access the personal information we have on
      file for you. You can reach out to us at any time to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Review what personal data we have about you</li>
      <li>Request updates or corrections to your information</li>
      <li>Ask us to delete any of your information</li>
      <li>
        Express any concerns you may have about the handling of your
        data
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not share mobile information with third parties or
      affiliates for marketing or promotional use. Text message opt-in
      data and consent are never shared with third parties under any
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <h4 class="visually-hidden">How We Ensure Secure Transactions</h4>
    <h2>Data Security and Protection</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your personal data is of utmost importance to
      us. We take significant precautions to ensure that your
      information is protected against unauthorized access, misuse, or
      disclosure. When you submit sensitive information via our
      website, such as payment details, that information is
      safeguarded both online and offline.
    </p>

    <p>
      All sensitive information—especially credit card data—is
      encrypted and securely transmitted using industry-standard
      protocols. You can confirm that you are on a secure page by
      looking for the closed padlock symbol in your web browser or
      verifying that the page URL begins with "https."
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond online encryption, we also enforce strict internal data
      protection practices. Only employees who require access to your
      personal information to perform specific tasks—such as customer
      support, billing, or marketing—are granted permission to view or
      use such data. All such data is stored within a digitally
      secured system, protected by appropriate access controls.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy Concerns and Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding our
      Privacy Policy or your personal information, we encourage you to
      get in touch with us directly. We are here to assist and ensure
      that your experience with Malani Jewelers is secure, respectful,
      and transparent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please be aware that Malani Jewelers reserves the right to
      modify this policy at our discretion. Any revisions will be
      reflected on this page, and changes will take effect as soon as
      they are posted. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically
      to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
