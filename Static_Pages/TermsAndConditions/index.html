      <p>
        MalaniJewelers.com is not liable for direct, indirect,
        incidental, special, or consequential damages from use of the
        website. Some states do not allow this exclusion, so it may
        not apply to you.

      <h2>Product Display & Colors</h2>
      <p>
        We aim for accuracy, but colors may appear differently based

        color. Exchanges/returns will not be honored for these
        variances.
