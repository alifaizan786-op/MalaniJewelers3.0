        We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. By

        our terms. If you disagree, please discontinue use of the
        website.

      <h2>Site Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        Users may not tamper with the site, misrepresent their
        identity, use buying agents, or engage in fraudulent
        activities.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        MalaniJewelers.com is not liable for direct, indirect,
        incidental, special, or consequential damages from use of the
        website. Some states do not allow this exclusion, so it may
        not apply to you.
      </p>

      <h2>Intended for Users Over 18</h2>
      <p>
        Users under 18 must use the website with a parent or guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Display & Colors</h2>
      <p>
        We aim for accuracy, but colors may appear differently based
        on your monitor. Handmade items may vary in shape and stone
        color. Exchanges/returns will not be honored for these
        variances.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Sizes</h2>
      <p>
        Size accuracy may vary. Please call us for confirmation prior
        to purchase if size is not listed.
      </p>

      <h2>Errors on Site</h2>
      <p>
        Prices and availability may change without notice. We may
        cancel orders or correct errors, even after submission.
        Refunds will be issued for any charges made in such cases.
      </p>
